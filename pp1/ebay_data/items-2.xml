    <Description>This is a very old Mrs. Santa Claus shaker. I guess poor Santa was broken. She has spaghetti trim. You_ll have to look at the picture to determine how much original paint is missing; I have never seen a picture of her. She has a silver Napco label and is numbered 5920. She has a cork too, but I haven_t tried to remove it, it looks pretty embedded. I don_t see any chips or cracks, but I see dust between the spaghetti fringes. Here is the story, if you are interested. My great grandmother passed away in 1982 at the age of 93. My grandmother is now 93, and she says it_s just too much for her to continue to decorate for Christmas. My mother, has sorted through all of the ornaments and goodies, has kept way too many, and gave me the rest to sell on eBay. You may want to glance at some of my other auctions.

    <Description>Just in time for the Holidays!!! Here are SIX beautiful vintage drapes (3 PAIR) made with the most gorgeous floral fabric! There are MANY lovely colors to the various flowers (roses, rosebuds, tulips,...) on a very pretty darker cream background. I believe these date to the 1940's and are in very nice condition! EACH panel measures approx. 80" long (with a nice 3" weighted hem), 26" wide at the pinch pleated top, and 44" at the bottom. Just some small areas of slight wear on the edges of a few of them, and they are no longer lined. The fabric is heavier in weight, with a nice nubby texture (similiar to barkcloth). These have recently been dry cleaned and are READY TO HANG to add vintage CHARM and sophistication to your home! If you don't need all 6 panels, you could recover a side chair, recover your dining room chairs or make matching pillows. You will LOVE these!</Description>

    <Description>Welcome! So far I have put up around 2000 comics and have had overwhelmingly great feedback (409 positive and 0 negative or neutral in the last month). I use ebay picture service for these auctions and many people have asked for better pictures. This is what ebay offers so if you have any questions about condition of a book, email before you bid. I am listing these comics for my 80 year old neighbors family. He recently passed away. There seems to be about twenty box and I will slowly list them all, so please keep looking. I have done some research on other auctions and people seem to price different comics differently and assign a grade. I do not know how to do this so I will start each auction at $1.00 and what you see is what you get. Please bid accordingly. All comics come in plastic bags and have cardboard boards so they are well protected. I will ship up to 5 comics priority mail for $5.00. Each 5 comics after that will be $1.10 more. I will not ship any other method as I cannot guarentee delivery with any other method. Please agree to this before bidding and do not request any other form of shipping I accept paypal, checks or money orders. Auctions must be paid for within ten days or negative feedback will be left. Anyone not satisfied with their comic may return it and I will refund the purchase price. Not the shipping so please look carefully at the scan and ask any questions first. Remember it is very important for you, the buyer, to ask any questions before you bid. I am doing the best I can to sell these at reasonable prices and I believe that any comic I list is at least worth $1.00.

    <Description>X-MEN (1991) #1-16 Annual #1 (1992) NM+ Near Mint plus issues of the 1991 X-Men series that is now 10 years old but still affordable. Lot comes with all 5 covers of #1, including the Prestige Format #1e. Numbers 2 through 6, 8-9, 11-16 and Annual 1 are also included, but #7 and #10 are missing. Im selling off my private collection from the 1970s-1990s. The books have been preserved in bags with boards and in acid free longboxes for up to 20 years. Unless specified above, all comics are NM-/NM with no major creases or tears. Some have light stress on the spine. See scanned image for a representative sample. Many of these books deserve CGC consideration for those who have the time and money. Shipping is $5.00 and $1.00 more for optional insurance. I strongly suggest investing in insurance since books are shipped at buyer?s risk. This is the safest and quickest way to get your books. Alaska, Hawaii, and Canada add $1. Shipping is extra for large lots (over 10 books) and International destinations. For lots of over 30 comic books the buyer can have books shipped by Media Mail (Book Rate). Win my other auctions and combine shipping costs. All comics are bagged, most with backing boards, and are sent in sturdy boxes or Priority Mail envelope. Check my Feedback for evidence of secure shipping and bid with confidence. Payment is due within 10 days after the close of the auction. I accept the following methods of payment. 1) Money Orders, Cashiers Checks, Billpoint On-line Payment, and PayPal allow for quickest turnaround. Comics are shipped out within 24 hours of payment arrival. 2) Personal Checks (I will hold books for 5-7 days until check clears). 3) International orders use Billpoint or PayPal please. Thanks for visiting the site. Email your questions to me. I want your business as well as positive feedback.</Description>

    <Description>Pretty Framed Tulip Needlepoint with Butterfly and Fuzzy Caterpillar This piece reminds me of Vera tulip napkins I recently sold. I don't know if Vera had needlepoint designs but this certainly looks like Vera. Measures about 15" square - wooden frame is ivory with black speckles. Love the fuzzy 3-D caterpillar inching up a tulip stem. Ready to hang. May want to restretch/frame as there is a bit of excess of fabric near the lower right hand corner that looks like a little diagonal pull would straighten it out. Very nice work.

    <Description>PLEASE READ ** THE "FINE" PRINT ** BEFORE BIDDING! 2-headed Turtledove &amp; Heart PA Dutch / Amish Style Cast Iron Trivet My latest listings consist of several cast iron trivets that I bought from a local collector to help her lighten the load of her extensive collection as she prepared to move south. I do not collect trivets, so any information I include here is only what was passed to me, as I can not claim any personal expertise in the area. This cast iron trivet is a nice match to another one of my listings with a single turtledove. This trivet has a heart handle with an iron stand shaped plate. The main body has a two headed turtle dove with a heart shaped body, flanked by two more hearts. It has been painted with PA Dutch / Amish styled accent colors of blue, green, red and yellow. Measures 8 1/4" x 4". Rear markings: "260". Revision... I was calling this bird a turtledove until I received an email from a friendly eBayer (thanks lenka!) informing me that this is not a turtledove, but rather the "Mystical Distelfink with two heads so he is better able to watch more closely for evil to ward off and keep away from the distelfinks care giver. The farmer would also paint this bird on his barns to keep it and it's contents safe." That info got me curious and on the web site www.amishmarket.com, I found this description of a hex sign with a similar design: "Double Eagle (Courage) A large, stylized double headed bird, a double headed eagle, is shown in this design. The eagle represents strength and courage. The trinity tulips add faith, hope and charity; the heart add love. This design symbolizes strength and courage." This trivet doesn't have the trinity tulip, but it does have the hearts, and the bird looks like the double headed eagle shown on the hex sign. So, it looks like it's not a turtledove afterall, but either an Eagle or a Distelfink (goldfinch)!

    <Description>This is Hallmark_s Dollhouse Dreams from 1993 . A little girl adds Santa to her dollhouse as the fire flickers and lights blink on and off from room to room. The ornament has been tested and works perfectly. It is in mint condition with an excellent condition box, with price tag intact.

    <Description>I have for auction a 1987 Wilton Partysaurus Cake Pan, with a color insert and the instruction booklet for making a variety of "Saurus" cakes. The color insert is very helpful in showing what the cakes should look like when decorated and is a guide, it has all the different finished cakes on the back side of it. Also included is a Wilton "Complete Instructions for Baking &amp; Decorating Partysaurus Cakes". This booklet includes instructions for decorating the following cakes: basic dinosaur cake, Groomasaurus, Brainosaurus, Birthdaysaurus, and Sportasaurus. Instuctions are very detailed with directions as to what Wilton Cake tip to use with what part of the "saurus" one is decorating and icing recipes. The cake pan was purchased new from JC Penney's in 1987 by my mom and only used a few times. The cake pan is approximately 17 inches long and varies in widths. It has no dents, dings or warps in it. I will be happy to answer any emailed questions about my item.

Buyer to pay $13.00 for Priority Mail (2-3 day delivery) or $6.50 for Media rate (upto 14 day delivery) - buyers choice. Insurance is optional but recommended. If desired, insurance can be purchased at additional actual cost to buyer based on winning price. Uninsured packages are mailed at buyers risk.

If using Paypal please send payment to my eBay username (rbsurfshop@home.com). Please don't be a deadbeat bidder. I'm sure your mother raised you better than that. Terms And Business Practices: Call me old fashioned but I still prefer to do business via friendly and personalized email. You will not go through checkout lanes, lines or websites in order to do business with me. I don't like getting generic "send me the money" emails so I won't do that to you. It's all a bit too impersonal for me and I strive to maintain a very high quality of service. I think my feedback proves that. Feel free to contact me or I will contact you within 24 hours of auction end. Please ask questions ahead of time, I'm always happy to answer. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close and timely payment always insures positive feedback when payment is received.

    <Description>This is a beautiful set of steak knives that appear to be unused. The manufacturer is Everbrite, the blades are stainless steel, and the handles are made to look like antique, yellowed ivory. I suspect that the handles may be Bakelite or celluloid, but I don't know that for sure. The case is a faux leather, with gold embossing on the corners; the interior is red velvet with a lid of beige satin. Each knife is 8.5" long and each blade is stamped with "Everbrite, Stainless Steel". It appears to be a gift from the 1940s or so that was never used. Very pretty! Bid now! Personal checks, money orders, Mastercard, Visa and Discover Cards are accepted through PayPal, Billpoint and Bidpay. Buyer pays actual shipping and handling. Thanks for looking and enjoy your bidding!</Description>

The first is an Atlas Egg Slicer by Westmark and the second a De Luxe Chromium Churn Beater which can be used for sauces and gravies. Packaging on these utensils is very 50's and if you collect vintage kitchen utensils, these are a must have. Perfect for a kitchen shelf display.

    <Description>Just in time for holiday baking, I am offering this vintage nut chopper that is probably from the 50s (I remember my mother using one very similar to this). It is in excellent condition...the spring that keeps the chopper mechanism moving up and down is in sturdy condition and the blades are sharp. There is a wooden disc in the bottom which prevents the chopping blades from hitting against the glass of the one-cup measuring cup. It has a black wooden knob on the top that is flattened in shape for comfort while chopping many portions of nuts for holiday baking. The tin lid has a retro design of black and red on ivory color. It is in excellent used condition. Shipping within US is $4.50 for Priority Mail. Outside US is usually higher so please inquire before sending payment. Money Order/Check/Credit Card through eBay Payments (Billpoint) or PayPal. Thanks for looking and please click on my other auctions.</Description>

    <Description>These bowls are too cute. They are 16 oz each with a snowman and christmas tree motif. They have green one-touch seals with little handles on each side. These are great to give as gifts or to serve party nuts in. Contact me with any questions and check out my other auctions. I have more than one of these sets listed if you need more than two.

    <Description>Very Antique Graniteware Funnel Blue &amp; White This is the only one of these I have ever seen. I don't know if it was meant for household use or if it is an oil funnel for tractors etc. I will guess it is household. A very unique addition to your graniteware collection. Approx. 6" diameter and 7" high. In pretty rough shape but a great display piece. Please check out my other auctions this week as I am listing a lot of antiques, folk art and western stuff. Start the New Year out right by adding to your collections or by starting a new collection. We all know you can't have to much stuff. Happy Holidays from Montana. !!!!1 Remember, the odd change in your total purchase price is donated to Insulin Free World for Juvenile Diabetes Research. Good luck and thank you. Update 12 / 6 / 01. Thanks to all of you who have bought from me this past year we have contributed $200.00 . My 8 year old grandson thanks you also. The only remedy is a cure!!!!! Please do not use eBay checkout. If you are the winning bidder I will contact you or feel free to contact me using my e-mail address. I will accept your good check, a money order, bidpay or paypal.

The comics included are Book 1 (The Alien Alliance), Book 2 (Battleground Earth) and Book 3 (World without heroes). See my scan for the covers. I'm selling every comic in my house.

I have a 100% no questions asked return policy (minus shipping) for anyone who is not satisfied with their purchase. Buyer to add $5.00 for safe shipping to North America .

    <Description>PoP Comics This set includes the Dynamic Forces #1 regular cover and the Dynamic Forces #1 Sketch Cover, both with certificates. Our books are NM/M, bagged and boarded. Please check out our other items on ebay. Shipping in the U. S. is $3 book rate (between two pieces of cardboard and in a bubble envelope) or $4.50 priority (between two pieces of cardboard and in a USPS priority envelope), plus $2.00 for insurance. If you want them shipped or packed in a box, add $1. I will accept money orders or a check (cash is your responsibility). CANADIANS: The USPS stopped book rate shipping to Canada so be prepared to pay more for shipping. I do NOT accept Paypal or any other form of on line payment. Since I have been stiffed with a rubber check, I will now wait for them to clear, two weeks. If you win more than one auction, we can combine the items and save on shipping.

    <Description>Here's a really nice old Baker's Coconut Lamb cake mold from 1921 that we purchased at an antiques auction over the weekend. This old mold is in remarkable condition considering it's age. It doesn't look like it was ever used. On the inside of the mold, there was an old recipe card for "Coconut Lamb Cake". The interesting thing is that most of the brands the recipe calls for are either no longer being made or are very old famous well used brands. For instance, "Swans Down Cake Flour, Snow Frosting, and Calumet Baking Powder." The recipe card is dated 1921. The lamb mold measures 13 and 1/2" in length by 8" in height. This old mold looks as if it was a promotional item for The General Foods Corporation in the 1920's promoting Bakers Coconut. The mold also has "Baker's Coconut" embossed at the bottom beneath the Lamb. This is a great old piece of advertising, not to mention a wonderful collectible for the culinary person! This old Lamb mold would also just be a fabulous piece to display in a country kitchen. You also have the original old recipe card that came with the mold, so there's no excuse not to put this old mold to use!! Best of all NO RESERVE . Personal checks or money orders accepted. Checks must clear before shipping. We can accept Visa and MasterCard, but only via PayPal. All items sold as is, so please be sure to ask any questions before you bid.

    <Description>Incredible Hulk #4! Hey there! Welcome to my auctions for this week! Yup...it's the original. Hulk #4, a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby classic! This is a Good/Good+ copy. It's got lots of wear, but is still a solid copy. Both staples are still well attached, as is the centerfold. The book has a slight spine roll. The best part about this book is that the pages are supple and a GORGEOUS and SOLID off-white, as are the inside front covers! There is NO sign of color unevenness at all! Nice! This is part of a large collection I bought a while back from Showcase-New-England, and this is what they graded it, I agree, so you can be doubly sure of grading! Overstreet Guide for this book is $140.00 H A P P Y H O L I D A Y S ! The Holidays are upon us! This is an EXCELLENT gift for the comic collector you know and love, or even yourself ! ALL items PAID FOR by December 17th are GUARANTEED to ship in time for Christmas if shipped Priority! Cool, huh? GRADING: I've been collecting and selling for over 11 years...I care about comics, and condition, and I grade according to Overstreet and CGC standards. I grade strictly because I know what it's like to spend good money on a book that I REALLY wanted, only to be really disappointed when it shows up two grades lower than advertised. So, please bid with confidence! SHIPPING: Shipping will be $4.50 (isn't that crazy?) for USPS Priority Mail, or $2.50 Special Standard (Book Rate). Price includes Delivery Confirmation for both, and insurance can also be purchased. All books are shipped in sturdy packages...no point in selling nice books, and then having them damaged in shipping! And always, shipping is combined for multiple auction wins. International Bidders : I will ship the books anywhere in the world, but it gets SPENDY! I try to ship everything via Global Priority ($9US to most countries), but please note, there may be exchange and bank fees involved. I'm not making extra money, just passing on what I get charged. PAYMENT: Please DO NOT PAY until I have contacted you! This is very important, as it has led to some confusion in the past. Thank you! Hey, check out my other auctions here: Grayson's Auctions! Enjoy! The Small Print: 1. I answer ALL e-mail questions as soon as I receive them, so please do not hesitate to ask! 2. Winning bidder notifications will be sent out within 24 hours of auction's end. PLEASE READ the entire note, and pay attention to all details therein. I cannot tell you how many times I've received payments with absolutely NO identification as to what it's for, and then folks get mad when their shipment is delayed! 3. I have had an inordinate amount of non-paying bidders lately. I'm a decent and honest person, but even I get frustrated when people take advantage of me. So please, if you're not going to pay, for whatever reason, please just don't bid. If something happens in between the auction's end, and you sending payment, please do not wait for ME to contact YOU. Communication is the KEY, and usually resolves problems! 4. I can only ship once a week, as I cannot get to the Post Office more than that. Please be patient when expecting your book(s)! 5. If, after you receive your item(s), you're not happy for ANY reason...please let me know! I have zero negatives because I take care of my customers. We can work out a solution that works for everyone, if it comes to that. My focus is the COLLECTOR looking for specific items, not dealers, or other wholesalers. I want everyone to be not just satisfied, but HAPPY with what they purchase! Happy customers are repeat customers! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>New Page 13 This is a neat vintage panel in good condition (no tears, worn spots, or stains), perfect for creating a period look in just the right setting. These colors were "hot" in the late 1940's through the late 1950's. I am showing the piece as a runner (which it could certainly be), but it's actually hemmed top and bottom with a 1-3/4" hem and rod pocket. The sides are finished under also. It measures 16-1/2" wide and 49" long. Here are closer looks at the vibrant colors. The material is definitely cotton. You could also make several pillows from this material. It offers lots of possibilities to a creative person with a vintage penchant! Buyer to pay only actual shipping of $1.26 (5 ozs.) First Class mail in the US. I accept Paypal, personal checks, and money orders.</Description>

    <Description>Tell City Decorator's Fabric This fabric was hand picked by the decorator at a Tell City Store and 13 yards of it remain. This was purchased in the 70's to go with the Antique Painted Finishes of Red, Blue, Gold and Green that Tell City featured on many items. It is pictured with the antique green and I could email you a photo of it with a gold Tell City item. Unfortunately, I do not have any red or blue finishes to photo it with. I seasonally change the upholstery on the Tell City upholstered chairs and cushioned rockers for variety. My local upholstery lady has adapted velcro to enable easy change out of the skirts. The cushioned rockers do not need any special adaptions. This 13 yards is enough to probably do at least 2 and maybe 3 Tell City chairs depending on which chairs you have. The fabric is 36 inches wide and is on a cardboard bolt. It has been in a smoke free environment. It appears to be cotton. It is difficult to find authentic fabric for the Young Republic Group in today's fabric store. The reserve is less than the per yard than the price of new cotton. $6.00 shipping for the 48 states. No handling fee on this easy to package item. Insurance extra at buyer's discretion. Payment within 10 days. The antique green bread peel is new old store stock from the same Tell City dealer and could be put on buy it now if any Ebayers are interested in it. It has the original tag and is MINT!

    <Description>This is an unused Lazy Susan that I acquired in the early 1970s while stationed in the Far East. It was made in the Philippines but I forget the type of wood (maybe Monkey Pod?). It is 14" in diameter and 4" high, ideal for a small table. It has a central bowl (slightly less than 6" in diameter) surrounded by five other bowls on top of the rotating pedestal. It is in its original container. Buyer pays shipping costs. Immediate delivery for those paying by money order, cashier's check or PayPal; personal checks must clear first. When paying by PayPal, please send funds from a bank account, not a credit card. Please see another of my auctions for a bottle opener. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

LOT OF TWO VINTAGE SHAVERS This auction is for two electric shavers. The first one is a Ronson that works and comes in a case. The other one is Sunbeam that also works and comes in a leather pouch. These would be nice to add to your collection. Please see shipping costs/methods and insurance requirements below. For larger items please click here to email us for a quote. All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. DELIVERY CAN BE MADE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF OUR STORE ON OUR LARGER ITEMS. PLEASE EMAIL FOR A DELIVERY QUOTE The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Buyer to pay $4.50 for shipping and handling. All international bidders MUST email us for an adjusted S&amp;H quote! . Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&amp;H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro</Description>

If you have questions, please email me at icjobee@aol.com PLEASE READ TERMS I regret the need for this list, but after 3 years of selling, I have found it imperative, and tried to make it as concise as possible, and make sure you are informed. Winner pays shipping. Most items have fixed shipping in the listing ad. I ship Priority Mail unless otherwise stated. Envelope items with 1st class shipping do not include insurance and by accepting this method of shipping you are taking the risk of it being lost in the mail. Rare, but it can &amp; has happened. Money order or Visa &amp; MasterCard through PayPal Or PayDirect. Checks accepted for amounts under 30.00 with the right to wait 14 business days after the check arrives for checks to clear. Shipping days are Tuesday and Friday. If there are special circumstances, &amp; you need your package shipped on a different day, I will make every effort to comply. During the holiday season, I ship every weekday as sales warrant. Arkansas Sales will need to add 6.125% to the item price. Once I have your address I can calculate it for you. Please read the description. I make every effort to fully disclose all flaws in a short description. Vintage items are sold in the same condition I buy them. Due to nerve damage in my right hand &amp; arm, I cannot wash every item because I loose control. We pack every item VERY carefully, but occasionally breakage happens anyway, and the buyer is responsible for filing and collecting the insurance claim per the rules of the Postal Service. Sellers put a lot of time and money into having these auctions available for your consideration. Please be kind, only bid if you intend to follow through. As with many sellers, this is my only source of income and I depend on you honoring your bid. If I can help someone out by the use of any of my auction pictures, please feel free to use them. We all work hard at this and if I can save some time and trouble for you, I would be happy to. I realize they are not all the best, but.... you need not ask permission, as it is granted.</Description>

    <Description>T10 Red Linen Rectangle Table Cloth T10 Red Rectangle Table Cloth This beautiful item is a red rectangle tablecloth. The tablecloth is 75 inches x 61 inches in size. I have no idea what kind of fabric the tablecloth is made from although I believe it is cotton or a cotton blend. You can see the texture of the fabric as it is not a fine weave fabric. The deep rich color of the fabric adds to the luxurious quality of this tablecloth. I am pretty sure the fabric is not permanent press as it does crease fairly easily. This beautiful tablecloth belonged to my Mother in Law. I have no idea how old it is. I believe she used it under her lace tablecloths (separate auctions) for added color. I am no expert. However, from what I can see, the tablecloth is in mint condition. If you have any questions about this item, please email them before you bid. Payment by money order, cashiers checks or PayPal only.

    <Description>Tupperware Thatsa Bowl Item Description: This is a great bowl, with an enormous 32-cup capacity. It's 6 1/8"H x 14 1/2"W and has a one-of-a-kind thumb loop for a secure grip and a virtually liquid-tight seal for storage. Seal is *exclusive hunter green* with a large tab for easy removal. Bowl is white and useful for everything from mixing, to salads, to popcorn, as a fruit bowl, or for any number of craft projects. I've used ours for soaking my feet too - it's great! Brand new. Retail value is $16.50. Use it alone or couple it with measuring spoons, cups, kitchen towel and a rolling pin, pastry sheet, cookie mix, spaghetti, or similar items, and you've got a super, high-quality housewarming, Christmas, or wedding gift that will give years of everyday use and enjoyment!

    <Description>NO RESERVE! Adorable Holt Howard Pixie Pixieware Mustard pot with spoon. This cute condiment jar is fantastic with its sassy little pixie lid. The Pixie is yellow with a shock of orange hair. The mischevious smirk on the Pixie's face says it all. The pot is labeled Mustard and has yellow stripes on a white background. The lid is a pixie with spoon below for serving the mustard. These spoons are very fragile due to the thin neck and prone to breakage - this one is in excellent condtion. Marked on the bottom: c1958 Holt Howard Japan with the Original H/H Japan foil label too! Measurements: Overall height is 5 1/2" to the top of the Pixie. Mustard pot is 4 1/2" wide and 3" deep. The Pixie spoon is 5" long. Condition: Excellent condition with no chips or cracks. Piece has overall crazing as can be expected with these. This item is as close to mint as they come. The only reason why I didn't call it mint is due to the crazing. However as I said most all of these Pixie's have crazing so you be the judge. Shipping: Safe, secure, professional shipping $9.00 to USA &amp; Canada - Insurance optional/extra. Payment: Payment by money order, bank draft or cashiers check for immediate shipment, or by personal check with positive feedback rating over 25 (checks held till cleared).

    <Description>I am putting 4 Goonies glasses on tonight, I think that's the whole set. This is a mint condition set, one of them (data) still has the sticker on the bottom for money off a pitcher of Coca Cola from Godfathers (where these were given out). This auction is for the "Sloth Comes to the Rescue" glass. If you need one to complete a mint set or want a mint set, don't miss out on these. I hand washed them all, look great, NEVER in a dishwasher. No mars to the design, perfect. These are all about 5 1/2" tall. Shipping is 3.50 in the US, more international. I will ship one or all for that price, save a little on shipping. International shipping is more. International pays by cash, US bank check, BidPay or postal money order only. Thanks for looking at our ads and good luck in this and other auctions. Rich and Dale</Description>

    <Description>Talisman - America's Only Magic Weekly Partial File of 40 Issues I've probably subscribed to more magazines that have crashed and burned than anyone in the world. This is one of them. During the early 70's I looked forward, each week, to Jules Lenier's Talisman weekly. It was a small publication, printed on plain paper that contained some dynamite close up magic. It also contained Senatorial Observations by Clarke Crandall. No one ever forgot the Senator. I honestly don't remember how long this thing ran. The last issue I have is July 30, 1971. The first issue here is Number 14 - June 5, 1970. Lots of good reading and a rare item, I'm sure. NO RESERVE - $5 Opening Bid Condition: T he file is in surprisingly good shape. These were printed on inexpensive offset paper, so 30 years have resulted in some yellowing. I don't think anyone will be disappointed. Shipping: B uyer pays $5.00 for priority postage, packaging and tracking. Payment: I accept PayPal credit card payments. Immediate shipping! M oney order or a cashier check guarantees immediate shipment upon payment. P ersonal checks are welcome but shipment will be held until check clears (7-10 days), unless we have had successful dealings before Terms &amp; Conditions: P lease e-mail any questions prior to bidding. W e reserve the right to refuse a winning bid from a buyer with numerous negative feedback. W e reserve the right to cancel auction if bid retractions occur during last 24 hours of auction. P ayment must be received within 7 days of auction close. B uyer is responsible for a $25 fee charged by my bank for any returned checks due to insufficient funds.

    <Description>Dark Knight Strikes Again # 1 Batman New Click Images to Enlarge BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN #1 First Printing. In 1986, a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm, revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again, with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It's been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and everything is just fine. Perfect, in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn't know is that it's a total sham. A perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears, once and for all. It's not gonna be pretty. But at least it'll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer, more streamlined, and with a vitality that hasn't been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully, he must first return to being the World's Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World's Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller's collaborator, Lynn Varley.

    <Description>I think this item is an incense burner. It looks like someone burned something in it. With the lid on, it stands 3 1/2 inches high. I think it's made out of copper as that's what it looks like to me. There's no writing on it but the ribbon design makes me think of a loving cup. It's kind of heavy for no bigger than it is so it must be well made. Would make a nice item if you don't want the kids to know what you're doing in your room at night. Or, you could give it to the kids and then you won't know what they're doing! We ship priority mail and the buyer pays the postage ($3.90 in U.S.). We accept cashier's checks, personal checks, money orders, cash, or T-Bills only. See my other auctions for more wonderful junk.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

    <Description>The description for this item is listed below, but first please take a moment to read my auction terms, which are as follows: ***** I work on my auctions Monday through Friday (excluding Holidays) anywhere between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Central time, so I will be sending and responding to emails during only those days and times. There will occasionally be exceptions to this, depending upon what is going on, and I will try to make a note of it in my auction listings if there is an exception. ***** The buyer pays the actual shipping charge, and this charge is determined at the end of the auction by the buyer_s zip code and the package weight. I only ship within the U.S. Please see the item description to find the method of shipment for this particular item. ***** Shortly after the end of the auction, the high bidder will receive an email from me requesting a shipping address so that I can figure the total amount owed. If you are the high bidder, please do not use the Checkout link that may appear at the top of the auction page. I do not use eBay_s payment service. ***** Payment must be received within 10 days of the close of the auction, per the rules of eBay. This is what you agreed to by signing up on eBay, and I expect this rule to be followed. If payment is not received within 10 days and other arrangements have not been made, I will be forced to file a non-paying bidder alert with eBay. ***** I prefer payment with a Money Order or through PayPal. If payment is received in either of these two ways, the item will be shipped 1-2 business days after receipt of payment. Personal checks will be accepted from bidders who have a good positive feedback rating. The item will not be shipped until the check clears (7-10 business days). Thank you for taking the time to read my auction terms. Please email me with any questions. And now, the item description: Hokey_s Cups &amp; Balls Magic Trick with Original Box from 1955 (see photo at bottom of listing) The object of this trick is to make a ball appear to pass through the solid bottom of a cup. The box states, _The effect is miraculous_but it_s easy when you know how._ This magic trick was manufactured by Fun Incorp. in 1955. It has all the original parts. You get 3 plastic cups, 4 _balls_ which are actually little pompoms, and the instructions. The cups each stand 2 __ high and are in good condition, with no cracks. The box is missing part of one of the end flaps. It_s the part that tucks in to close the box, so the box doesn_t close completely. Otherwise the box is in good shape.

    <Description>First, let me just put in a little something about the new check out system. So far, it_s been my experience that it_s not quite perfected. Unless you_ve used it and are delighted with it, please don_t click on checkout. When you click on it I get an email instructing me to send you an invoice. I_ve had several double payments as bidders think they must pay from it after they_ve already sent payment via paypal. Paypal is by far my favorite but Billpoint is also accepted. I_ll send an email when the auction finishes _ usually within the hour. On with the listing_. Today I'm listing vintage textiles. Most of these were purchased at estate auctions. Because of that, I have no accurate idea of the age. Unless stated otherwise, you can expect them to be used and possibly stained. I'll do my absolute best to describe stains and any damage. Any piece that shows more than 2 or 3 small holes goes into the _cutter_ pile and will be listed as such. It's never my intention to misrepresent an item. Textiles are so difficult to list because, I know as a buyer myself, they are nice to feel before buying. Also, any round white spots are probably camera lens spots. I_ll be happy to combine multiple wins to save on shipping costs. This tablecloth measures 56 x 76 inches. It has no staining - no holes. (We think the yellow napkins match - see my listing of dozens of napkins.) The color is a soft buttery yellow. If the cloth is turned upside down it's more like the napkins. I start all listings at $1.00 _ if possible. I know half of the fun of eBay is bidding (the other half is winning!). Email any questions before bidding. I reserve the right to reject bids from anyone with negative feedback regarding payment. Payment is requested within 10 days of the close of the auction _ please do not bid if you have no intention to buy. Iowa residents add 7% sales tax. Methods of payment accepted are money orders, credit cards using Paypal.com &amp; Billpoint, and I will accept personal checks _ if you have at least 10 positive payment feedbacks. High bidder to add $5.20 toward shipping (international bidders see next paragraph). This amount does NOT include insurance _ I_m trying to keep your costs down. Insurance can be requested on any auction ($1.10 for the first $50 of value). I am not responsible for uninsured items or items that the post office loses. I pack as carefully as possible but accidents can occur. I am disappointed when something I order breaks and know that you are too. I_ve been shipping items for over a year and Priority Mail is the most cost effective method. Other arrangements can be made by request - especially on books and paper items. I try to watch for those winning multiple auctions and will combine for shipping savings. I mail Monday through Friday and your package will go out the next trip after payment is received _ I will email you confirming this. Because of ongoing difficulties with the Sioux City UPS customer counter I can only UPS parcels via Mail Boxes Etc. If you are an international bidder (this includes Canadians) you will need to send me your postal code and I will get you a shipping amount (for surface and air) at that time. I will not sign a customs form declaring the contents are a gift. I must let you know that the US Postal Service has discontinued the small packet rate. Shipping has drastically increased _ even to Canada. What I thought would cost $4 to ship was increased to $14. If payment is not received the following feedback will be left _ _as promised _ negative feedback due to nonpaying bidder_. I was kind last year and burned a few times. If your payment will be delayed, please let me know - I understand things do happen. Thanks for taking the time to look and check out my other auctions for similar items! I accept US &amp; International bidders &amp; payment with a major credit card via B id P ay . Fast, easy &amp; secure. www.BidPay.com Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Click here to view Picture 2. TICARJEV DOM 1611M old Stick PIN WOW! GREAT DEAL An exciting discovery for your pin person; valuable addition to any Pin collection, this Bicycle event or perhaps Mtn. climb event. TICARJEV DOM 1611M old PIN might be more valuable than your average pin. I say this not from knowledge but because it was on an old yellowed piece of cardboard with the best pin that we have listed at the moment. See them all on our seller list right now. Here is some more information on this great offering: The pin is 1 1/16" wide and is 2" tall. It is not marked on the back just what you can see on the front. Items are offered as discovered and not shined or altered in any way. Shipping is 2.00 first class mail. Thanks for looking! Low starting bids and never a reserve price. I estimate the cost of shipping and usually come up not charging enough. The shipping in the ad is the shipping you pay, no added costs later. If shipping seems high ask for an adjustment according to your zip code. Always include address and ebay item number in any email. All auctions are offered "as is &amp; final", but I am reasonable and will try to address any bona fide complaint and refund the purchace price to you if it is called for [does not apply to shipping].

    <Description>These beautiful 8" squares are leftover pieces from items being cut for baby accessories: crib sheets, portable crib sheets, carriage sheets, receiving blankets, etc. featuring baby pink stars on a pure white background. They are of the finest quality 100% cotton knit and could be made into almost anything. Luxuriously soft to the touch. There are 100 squares in this deal, each measuring 8"x8" square. Actual fabric does not have the lavender misprint which is showing in this photo. I don't know where that came from. These fabrics are brand new, unused, and printed on a solid white background. Combine this pack with others and save a bundle on shipping. Actual fabric much more beautiful than photo. I will accept personal/business checks or money orders, as well as PAYPAL. Please allow 5-7 business days for personal check clearance. I ship UPS ground only. Please do not bid if you live in Hawaii, Alaska or Canada. GOOD LUCK!!!

    <Description>this is a MCC 98 sketchagraph of tigra by tamara relleck or pelleck. Its a nice full body shot showing tigra crouching under a tree branch holding on to it. A very hard artist to find not to mention a very hard charator to find!!!Shipping can be done internationally however please note registering the card will be $7.50 and postage will be an additional $2 for one card and multiple cards (more than one) will be $5 more in addition to the $7.50, because of this if your an international buyer please only bid if you take this into consideration and realize it will be expensive to just ship the item. Please take this into consideration and consider buying more than one card to make shipping worth it or consider it for a single card if the card is worth it to you or its an expensive card and you figure it into th cost. recap here $9.50 for one card or $12.50 for multiple cards under 5 more than that it will be a little more. domestic buyers one card sent in a regular envelope insured will be $2 and more than one under 5 cards will be sent priority for $3.50 plus the insurance worth the cost of the cards. insurance is not an option for domestic buyers its part of the cost in the transaction in case the card is not delivered and the cost of the card needs to be replaced by the PO not me. if you have any further questions please feel free to email me. U.S buyers are expected to pay by United States postal money orders only or cash if the item is under $10 but even than a USPMO is the only form i truelly except in case a problem arises. International bidders payment will only be accepted by International Money orders. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This is a SUPER item to set on a "Bar" for the ultimate conversation piece - or just use the "Stopper" in a collection you may have and do away with the "Jug". The "Stopper" measures approx. 4 in. tall and is made of "Porcelain". The "cork" is in good conditon and there are no cracks-chips or dings in the "Stopper". The "Jug" measures approx. 6 in. tall and reads: This Will Make Your Eyes Bulge. There is one small "nick or flake" out of the bottom of the "Jug" - but it is hard to see when it is sitting on a counter or shelf. The "flake" measures approx. 1/2 in. x 1/2 in.

    <Description>Step onto Desilu Stage 9 with Robert H. Justman! Profiles in History's Once in a Lifetime Experiences presents Dinner with Robert. H. Justman! What Star Trek fan wouldn't jump at the chance to spend an evening with one of the most beloved figures in Star Trek History? One very fortunate bidder will have that chance. The esteemed Mr. Justman needs no introduction to Star Trek fans, but here is an opportunity to spend a private evening with a true gentleman, a charming conversationalist, a genuine insider and a font of Star Trek knowledge, at one of the most "in" spots in LA - the famous Wolfgang Puck restaurant - Spago's Beverly Hills If you are the high bidder, you and a guest will be flown to Los Angeles where your personal Towncar awaits you. You will glide in luxury up the famous 405 freeway and down Sunset Boulevard, through Beverly Hills and into the heart of Hollywood, where your room at the grand old historic Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel has been reserved. This is the true Grande Dame of Hollywood - the site of the first Academy Awards Presentation and the glamorous gathering place of the biggest stars in Motion Picture History. Here, you will have time to relax, and freshen up before you meet Mr. Justman and his gracious, elegant wife for dinner. Your Towncar will drive you to Spago's where the food is the exquisite and the clientele exclusive. This is a unique and very limited opportunity to ask the questions you've always wanted to ask, discuss the subjects you want to discuss - and experience the luxury of a private dinner with a Star Trek legend. Of course Jamie Lee Curtis or Billy Crystal just might be at the next table. But you'll probably be so engrossed in Mr. Justman's tales and anecdotes (not only of Star Trek but his many, many other shows) that you won't even notice. When your dinner is over - your Towncar awaits to return you to your hotel, or to explore LA Nightlife on your own. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel is across from the Chinese Theater, convenient to Universal Studios, the Sunset Strip, and other major attractions, and only one block from the brand new entertainment &amp; shopping Complex, Hollywood and Highland! Be the first to go where no fan has gone before - into the private life of this distinguished and beloved repository of Star Trek lore. This item is one of more than 500 pieces of Star Trek memorabilia, all from the collection of Star Trek Art Director Matt Jefferies, Executive in Charge of Production Herb Solow and Producer Bob Justman. Our highlight items - over 300 - will be auctioned off live on December 12, 2001 at 2:00 pm PST.

    <Description>I think this set is from 1986, and is marked on the bottom 'An exclusive Avon design by Pfaltzgraff". The small canister is 6" tall, the medium is aobut 7 1/2", and the largest is about 9" tall. They are all 5" across. The scene carries over from one cannister to the next, and is a Norman Rockwell like farm scene. The small canister has a hairline crack, which I attempted to show in the second photo. Shipping to US addresses is $7, others please email for shipping fee. Please click on the View My Gallery link for a link to discounted books, music, DVD's, gifts and much more.
